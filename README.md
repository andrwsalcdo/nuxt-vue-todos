# nuxt-vue-todos

first app with Nuxt.js

NOTE: Choose to use version 0.10.6 of Nuxt, as opposed to the current alpha v5 at the time of this writing. Alpha v5 is not stable, and for the purposes of becoming familiar with Nuxt, I thought it best to use the most stable version with supporting official documentation. 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
